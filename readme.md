# Convolutional Neural Network from Scratch to classify One Piece Characters

The code in this repository is a modification of the code contained in the sources referenced below. Many of the examples found work only for binary black and white images. This repository contains code that hopes to classify images from the one piece anime into their respective characters. The code is written in python and uses the cupy library to run on the gpu. The code is still in development and is not yet ready for use.

The data set used is the [One Piece image classifier](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ibrahimserouis99/one-piece-image-classifier) from kaggle. The data set 650 images per character, images were resize to 256x256 pixels. 18 characters.
